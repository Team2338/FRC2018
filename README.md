## Use
This repository makes use of the GradleRIO project which gives us faster build/deploy times
and more freedom in IDE choice. To prepare the project for use in IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended),
use PowerShell (or equivalent) to navigate to the project directory and execute **./gradlew idea**.
This will generate idea project files, so go ahead and open it. All other GradleRIO info can be found
at [the official GradleRIO repository](https://github.com/Open-RIO/GradleRIO).
